# FileExtractor
Small utility for moving all files in a directory tree, to a single folder.  Used for large scale document turn over packages, or project archival.


Quick way to move all project files out of an organized directory tree, into a single folder for project turn over and/or archival.

Select the origin folder(root) of the directory tree.
Select the destination folder, or create a new one. in a short time all files will be copied to the destination, ready for turn over.

PySimpleGUI 4.55.1 is a dependant (I am sure other versions will work fine)
